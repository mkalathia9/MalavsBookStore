I Open the instruction ppt and start working on the Visual studio 2019, the same BookStore Assignment but its part 2

i complete 6 pages of the ppt and as mention in the ppt i'm getting all the output as mentions 
then suddenly i got email from my prof. that tomorrow class is cancelled :P

But still i continue working on the assignment and complete 2.2 repository section but in that im having many errors, it took almost 
one and half hour to solve the error and finally i did it.
